##Team Basil 361 Project
This is the repository for Team Basil's CS 361 implementation project.

The website can be found at [basil.andrewtolvstad.com](basil.andrewtolvstad.com).
The server is configured to pull from the master branch of this repository every 5 minutes, so any changes can be viewed in near real time.

The project was implemented with Agile/XP as the development method.
From the initial design documents, 10 user stories were chosen to be implemented over the course of the two week project. 
Each story was treated as its own branch, and as they were completed, they were merged into `master`.
Details on each story can be found in their respective PR's.

####Week 1
Ideally this week saw the implementation of stories 1-5, which dealt with general use of the website.
Not all projected stories were implemented by the end of the week, however.
Stories 1 and 2 were delayed, and rescheduled to be implemented in week 2.

####Week 2
This week will see the implementation of stories 1 and 2 from week 1, as well as stories 6-10 which were originally scheduled for this week.
